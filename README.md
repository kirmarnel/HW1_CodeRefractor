# HW1_CodeRefractor

For this project I was given code to make more accessible. One of the main things that I did was replace the div tags with semantic html. This gives the code a better, more easy to read structure. It will also help make using a screen reader run more smoothly. Another way that I made this site more accessible was by adding alt attributes to the images. This will allow the image description to be read allowed by a screen reader. In addition, I improved the indentation and added comments to the code for easier reading and debugging. For this project I was given the following acceptance criteria which I believe has been met:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
